Backslash followed by {}()"'\ always mean themselves.

Whitespace rules

Need to support all of these:
\section:
    \code#:
        foo
            bar
          baz
    Hmm
    \code#:
        foo
      bar
        baz
            bap
       barrow
      qux
     quz


Which probably requires that so long as it's kept above the indent level of the \code by INDENT or MISDENT, the
parser considers it to be part of the block.

VASTLY easier is to require some suitable character, pipe looks good, between the whitespace used for indentation and that which is in a literal block and must be taken literally.
