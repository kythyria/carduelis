Backslash followed by {}()"'\ always mean themselves.

Whitespace rules

Need to support all of these:
\section:
    \code#:
        foo
            bar
          baz
    Hmm
    \code#:
        foo
      bar
        baz
            bap
       barrow
      qux
     quz


Which probably requires that so long as it's kept above the indent level of the \code by INDENT or MISDENT, the
parser considers it to be part of the block.

VASTLY easier is to require some suitable character, pipe looks good, between the whitespace used for indentation and that which is in a literal block and must be taken literally.

Hmm, how to lex/classify? Take cue from TeX?
  Escape        "\\"
  Name start    /[A-Za-z]/        (borrow the XML def for i18n?)
  Name          /[-_:A-Za-z0-9]/  (should : be legal here? It'll make ' bodies less useful)

Can we abstract over rowan *and* various AST impls enough to have a consistent handling? Even if rowan has its own, we might want many ASTs.

XPath has a reasonable model for querying any tree-ish; a query is a series of flat_map() where the available expressions include "one step along an axis" and "filter by predicate". In fact it already has multichildren, to deal with attributes. Of course, one of those axes is "descendants".

A subset of XPath is equivalent to operating on the path zipper.
